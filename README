ActsAsTaggedTree
================

== Introduction

ActsAsTaggedTree creates and maintains a tree where the following structure exists:
root -+
      |
      + Tag1+
      |     |
      |     + node1
      |     + node2
      + Tag2+
      |     |
      |     + node3
      + Tag3+
            |
            + node1
            + node3

Note that nodes can exist in more than one tag.

== Requirements

ActsAsTaggedTree requires the following gems/plugins:
acts_as_tree
acts_as_taggable_on[_steroids]

It will work with either acts_as_taggable_on or acts_as_taggable_on_steroids

== Installation

  rails plugin install git://github.com/viglesias/acts_as_tagged_tree


== Usage

=== Prepare database
Generate and apply the migration:

  ruby script/generate acts_as_tagged_tree_migration
  rake db:migrate

=== Modify your tagged model

Within your tagged model add

acts_as_tagged_tree [:label => :property]


:property is an optional property which is used as the label of a node
in the tree.  By default it is name

Example
=======

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_taggable
    acts_as_tagged_tree :label => :title
  end

Optionally you can add a :treemap => true to the arguments of the
acts_as_tagged_tree call and it will add the ability of
acts_as_treemap to the tagged tree.  Bear in mind you'll have to
install acts_as_treemap if you do so.  You can optionally add size and
color methods to your Model to adjust the size and color of the node
in a treemap.
